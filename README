* Grammar Implementation Notes

The grammars have been ported from the Python version of the Lisp originals.

Optional elements have been implemented using <optional-*> rules, which expand to <nothing> if they should not return anything. <nothing> expands to "".

This is more verbose than allowing inline probabilities would be, but works well with the RiTa Grammar system.
